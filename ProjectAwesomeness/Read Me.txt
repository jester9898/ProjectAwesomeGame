The player control model is in the ragdoll.zip file. 
The reason we did this is because of internet uploading issues, files were uploading in the kilobytes, hence
we decided to seperate them. 

The control to move is arrow keys, space to jump, and camera movement is wasd. 

The camera and the control did not blend in well, hence we are using arrow keys to move.
